\format{An object of class \code{R6ClassGenerator} of length 24.}
\usage{
FCSourceVector
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Optional character vector indicating name for Corpus object.}

\item{x}{Character vector or a list of character vectors containing text.}

\item{collapse}{Logical. If true, collapse the character vectors into
a single document.}
}
\description{

}
\details{
Sources a Corpus object from a character vector or vectors. Each vector element
is treated as a separate document unless the collapse paramter is set to TRUE.
If a list is encountered, each list element is treated as a separate document
and the vectors are collapsed into a single document within the list
structure.
}
\section{Methods}{

 \itemize{
  \item{\code{new(x, name = NULL)}}{Initializes an object of the FCSourceVector class.}
  \item{\code{execute()}}{Executes the process of sourcing the Corpus object.}

Disney to upstarts like Uber.")
